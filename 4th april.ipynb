    "## Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric is crucial for assessing the performance of a classification model and making informed decisions about its effectiveness. Different evaluation metrics can provide different insights into the model's performance and can be more or less appropriate depending on the specific goals and constraints of the problem.\n",
    "## For example, accuracy is a commonly used evaluation metric that measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. However, accuracy can be misleading when the classes are imbalanced, meaning that one class has much fewer instances than the other. In such cases, a model that always predicts the majority class can still achieve a high accuracy, even though it fails to correctly classify the minority class. In this situation, precision, recall, and F1 score are often more appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",

    "## 2. Cost of errors: Different types of errors (false positives or false negatives) may have different costs or consequences in the specific application. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, false negatives (failing to identify a disease) can be more costly than false positives (identifying a disease that isn't present).\n",
